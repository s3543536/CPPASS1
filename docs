dictionary search is very quick, as searching through a map has logarithmic
complexity. it would be on order of:
	n log m
	where
		n = number of words in source text
		m = number of words in the dictionary

this is because the dictionary search has to iterate through all the files in
the input text, but it can use the search functionality on the dictionary

the same cannot be said for the edit distance, since that has to compare every
word in the input text against every word in the dictionary anyway. its
complexity would be:
	n * m
	where
		n = number of words in source text
		m = number of words in the dictionary
